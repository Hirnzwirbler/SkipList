# SkipList
Implementation of a skip list in Python (for learning purposes)

Main goal was to implement a skip list just with the theoretical knowledge in order to improve at general 
implementations of algorithmic concepts.

There are still some things that can be added or improved but since the basic challenge was successful I might not
revisit this repository.

In the file is also a very basic implementation of a linked list, just to prove that I understand the basics of the 
skip list which is an improved linked list.
